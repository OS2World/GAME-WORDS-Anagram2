/* There are two tricks.  First is the Basic Idea:
 *
 * When the user types in a phrase, the phrase is first preprocessed to
 * determine how many of each letter appears.  A bit field is then constructed
 * dynamically, such that each field is large enough to hold the next power
 * of two larger than the number of times the character appears.  For example,
 * if the phrase is `hello, world', the bit field would be
 *
 *   00 00 00 000 000 00 00
 *    d e   h   l   o  r  w
 *
 * The phrase `hello, world', itself would be encoded as
 *
 *   01 01 01 011 010 01 01
 *    d e   h   l   o  r  w
 *
 * and the word `hollow' would be encoded as
 *
 *   00 00 01 010 010 00 01
 *    d  e  h   l   o  r  w
 *
 * The top bit of each field is set in a special value called the `sign'.
 * Here, the sign would be
 *
 *   10 10 10 100 100 10 10
 *    d  e  h   l   o  r  w
 *
 * The reason for packing the values into a bit field is that the operation
 * of subtracting out the letters of a word from the current phrase can be
 * carried out in parallel.  for example, subtracting the word `hello' from
 * the phrase `hello, world', is merely
 *
 *    d e   h   l   o  r  w
 *   01 01 01 011 010 01 01 (dehllloorw)
 * - 00 00 01 010 010 00 01 (hlloow)
 * ========================
 *   01 01 00 001 000 01 00 (delr)
 *
 * Since none of the sign bits is set, the word fits, and we can continue.
 * Suppose the next word we tried was `hood'.
 *
 *    d e   h   l   o  r  w
 *   01 01 00 001 000 01 00 (delr)
 * - 01 00 01 000 010 00 00 (hood)
 * ========================
 *   00 00 11 000 110 01 00
 *         ^      ^
 * A sign bit is set.  (Two, actually.)  This means that `hood' does not
 * fit in `delr', so we skip it and try another word.  (Observe that
 * when a sign bit becomes set, it screws up the values for the letters to
 * the left of that bit, but that's not important.)
 *
 * The inner loop of an anagram program is testing to see if a
 * word fits in the collection of untried letters.  Traditional methods
 * keep an array of 26 integers, which are then compared in turn.  This
 * means that there are 26 comparisons per word.
 *
 * This method reduces the number of comparisons to MAX_QUAD, typically 2.
 * Instead of looping through an array, we merely perform the indicated
 * subtraction and test if any of the sign bits is set.
 */

/* The nuts and bolts:
 *
 * The dictionary is loaded and preprocessed.  The preprocessed dictionary
 * is a concatenation of copies of the structure:
 *
 * struct dictword {
 *     char bStructureSize;             -- size of this structure
 *     char cLetters;                   -- number of letters in the word
 *     char achWord[];                  -- the word itself (0-terminated)
 * }
 *
 * Since this is a variable-sized structure, we keep its size in the structure
 * itself for rapid stepping through the table.
 *
 * When a phrase is typed in, it is first preprocessed as described in the
 * Basic Idea.  We then go through the dictionary, testing each word.  If
 * the word fits in our phrase, we build the bit field for its frequency
 * table and add it to the list of candidates.
 */

/*
 * The Second Trick:
 *
 * Before diving into our anagram search, we then tabulate how many times
 * each letter appears in our list of candidates, and sort the table, with
 * the rarest letter first.
 *
 * We then do our anagram search.
 *
 * Like most anagram programs, this program does a depth-first search.
 * Although most anagram programs do some sort of heuristics to decide what
 * order to place words in the list_of_candidates, the search itself proceeds
 * according to a greedy algorithm.  That is, once you find a word that fits,
 * subtract it and recurse.
 *
 * This anagram program exercises some restraint and does not march down
 * every branch that shows itself.  Instead, it only goes down branches
 * that use the rarest unused letter.  This helps to find dead ends faster.
 *
 * FindAnagram(unused_letters, list_of_candidates) {
 *  l = the rarest letter as yet unused
 *  For word in list_of_candidates {
 *     if word does not fit in unused_letters, go on to the next word.
 *     if word does not contain l, defer.
 *      FindAnagram(unused_letters - word, list_of_candidates[word,...])
 *  }
 * }
 *
 *
 * The heuristic of the Second Trick can probably be improved.  I invite
 * anyone willing to improve it to do so.
